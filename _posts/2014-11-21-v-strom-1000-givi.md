I got the Givi Outback Trekkers and installed them on my V-strom 1000 2014. Have to say they are great cases. Out of the two sizes I got the smaller ones, 37l each, a little too small to fit a helmet, but are only a little bit wider then motorcycle handlebars. Keeping the bike nice and nimble. 

As the bike currently stands a lot of stuff has been done, in the last month. I will post pictures of the givi rear rack and luggage as well as the hand guards with LED turn signals.
