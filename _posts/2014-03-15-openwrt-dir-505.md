Getting OpenWRT on it was a little tricky, you either need to compile and patch it yourself, or download a precompiled image from the forum.

One of the nice things about the DIR-505 is that it has a webbased recovery mode (uboot). So playing around with images is nice and easy.

Once the current trunk build can be verified, a link will be posted to the image. Two versions are build, one to update from teh original firmware, the other to upgrade from a currently openwrt installed unit.
