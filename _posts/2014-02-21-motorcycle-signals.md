A quick check of the NeoPixel library from [Adafruit](http://www.adafruit.com/), let me to look at other options and I found [FastLed](http://fastled.io/).

Also created the [repo](https://github.com/infamy/MotoSignals) for it. As I play around I will update the code and put all the documentation for the project into the repo.

My current concern is if the Adafruit Trinket will have enough code space if not I will need to step up to something a little more beefy. In terms of IO pins, it has just the right number, 2 output pins to run 2 rgb led strips, 3 inputs, brakes, right turn, left turn.
