After getting the 3dprinter more or less assembled. I started work on putting the J-head together. It is fairly simple to put together, and since it uses a 5W power resistor as the heading element, it is easy to repair.

The tricky part is making sure to use high temp wire and kapton tape so nothing that is not suppose to melt does not melt during a print job.
