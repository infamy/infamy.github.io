A few month back there was a kickstarter for a nice premium mini arcade cabinet. Having backed the project I received my PiCade Maxi, the larger of the two versions made sporting a nice 13" display.

Below are a few photos from the build. It when together fairly easily, taking about 2h to put together.

The only real thing to note is that the arcade buttons don't feel nearly as nice as some of the others ones I have, and I will need to swap those out in the future.

Back off the PiCade putting in the filling.
