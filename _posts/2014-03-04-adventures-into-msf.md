Based on the original compact python reverse shell posted a few days, I made a new Metasploit payload. It's only advantage over the current one built into metasploit, is that it would be less known, and smaller, so it may be usefull with certain input limitations.

More payloads and exploit will come as time passes. But for now, [reverse_python_compact.rb](https://github.com/infamy/msf4/blob/master/modules/payloads/singles/cmd/unix/reverse_python_compact.rb).
