I got my HackRF One shortly after defcon, and started playing around with it. I was having a lot of issues getting anything usefull out of it, and then I updated the firmware on the unit with the latest compiled one off the hackrf github, 2014.4.1 And that seems to have solved almost all my issues.

Now picking up all the local FM broadcast at the same time, or almost, 20mhz of bw. Not bad at all.
