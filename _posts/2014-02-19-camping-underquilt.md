Hammock camping dictates the use of some form of underquilt to help stay warm. Due to more heatloss while sleeping in a hammock from underneath then in a tent.

Based on the online design from [DIYGearSupply][diygearsupply] using their underquilt [design][underquilt]. Using Insultex from [DIYGearSupply][diygearsupply] and light grey 1.1oz nylon riptop, from [RipStopByTheRoll][ripstop].

Here is a photo of it packed away in its stuff sack! It's  stuff sack needs to be readjusted to be smalled since I would say it only fills about 2/3 of it currently.![stuff sack]({{ site.url }}/assets/2014-02-19-underquilt-packed.jpg)

And fully open. Its about 58" by 44". I do plan on making a 900fp goose down one, if this works out.![underquilt]({{ site.url }}/assets/2014-02-19-underquilt-open.jpg)

It still needs an attachment system to tie it to the hammock. I have most of the hardware just need to figure out the correct lengths.
