More sidemount adventures! I have had a chance to dive sidemount a few more times in cold water. As well as the chance to single tank sidemount in Belize for a few dives. Sidemount is not for everyone, you need to be more vigilant and confident of your gear setup and management. But if you are willing to do deal with the little bit of extra hassle the freedom in the water is really great. Also ran the same BC in cold and in warm water. No changes to my setup. Pack size was tiny, with my BCD, my fins, regs. Taking up less then 30l of my luggage. Which is almost half the size of my normal warm water travel setup!

On that note a warm water dive selfie.
