Getting into motocamping, I figured out pretty quickly that my tent poles + any form of motorcycle luggage make for unpleasant packing.

Based on the online design from [DIYGearSupply][diygearsupply] using their hex tarp [design][hextarp]. I ended up getting the fabric from a different source in a light grey. 1.1oz silnylon riptop, from [RipStopByTheRoll][ripstop] would highly recommend.

Here is a photo of it packed away in its stuff sack![stuff sack]({{ site.url }}/assets/2014-02-18-tarp-packed.jpg)

It still needs to be seam sealed, will get more photos of it full spread out then.
